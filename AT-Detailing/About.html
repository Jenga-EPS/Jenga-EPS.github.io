        <p>Logan Sanborn and Alexander Tsilas, high school juniors with an insatiable passion for cars, found themselves drawn to the world of automotive aesthetics during a transformative summer break. It all began when the two friends stumbled upon a local car detailing workshop that piqued their interest. Intrigued by the meticulous process of restoring and enhancing a vehicle's appearance, Logan and Alexander decided to delve into the art of car detailing. They spent their summer attending workshops, researching techniques, and practicing their skills on their own vehicles. What started as a casual exploration soon turned into a full-fledged passion project, with the duo perfecting the art of washing, waxing, and polishing cars to a pristine finish. Their shared enthusiasm not only strengthened their friendship but also sparked a newfound entrepreneurial spirit as they began offering their detailing services to friends and neighbors. Logan and Alexander's journey into car detailing not only allowed them to refine their skills but also provided a fulfilling way to combine their love for cars with a hands-on, creative endeavor.</p>
